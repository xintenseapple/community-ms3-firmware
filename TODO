TODO for:

1.4

Pushed back to 1.5
James
- Perfect run VSS + RPM at same time + general TC review (include Alex if poss.)
- "Barton" wheel decoder issues (awaiting feedback)

Ken
- Add engine states, change features that need it to use it. (Ken, started)
- Boost wastegate dome control (Ken, in progress)
- Possible A/C/Fan changes - See requests from rx7club (Ken)
- Understand why very retarded ignition causes weirdness in some wheel modes.
- Allow greater trigger angle tweak (currently +/-20) Needs testing after change.
Both
- Investigate possible race condition on VVT tooth decoding. (Poss fixed pending feedback.)

2.0
- New ReqFuel
- Add angle clock (Ken)
- Rudimentary pre-emptive multitasking (Ken)
- Lambda

For review:
- EGO backpressure correction table/curve.
- Consider more Nissan CAS modes
- Inj dead time test mode. Swaps from seq to two pulses in quick succession (to maintain inj timing) (James, P8)
- MAF burnoff
- Monitor/graph 'trigger' time to monitor power per cylinder.
- Gear/speed related timing
- Multi-spark
- Boost limited by CLT
- Baro based timing adjustment
- SD card format utility
- "Capture" mode to monitor and capture PW, spark timing, inj timing, VVT timing from engine running on other ECU
- Baro from WOT?
- WUE vs. RPM (if required?)/fuel vaporization instead?
- Rehome stepper idle on close (to avoid losing steps.)
- VE curve (experimental)
- Consider: fast PID on timing, slow PID on idle-valve pos
- More tri-tach options if possible
- Audi flywheel mode (James, P2 - awaiting more testing)
- Allow different PT pins for triple trigger.
- Race profiles (can include boost) to alter launch, nitrous, boost per user input.
- Idle valve operation during overrun - already covered in CL?
- CAN extension stuff from Reverent - perhaps?

Done:
- 36-2-2-2 H6 application (initial)
- NGC 6cyl cam sync - decoder done and phasing confirmed
- CAN broadcast zero packets
- Nitrous + launch
- Linelock staging
- Suby H6
- Output to start Go-Pro when SDcard datalog starts.
- Allow kPa to trigger SDlogging
- Advanced setting to flip cam input polarity for hardcoded modes.
- CAN turbo vane control
- EGO sensor response time scaling.
- Nitrous/fuel solenoids - different software PWM frequencies
- Fix corruption of data for raw 'A' when Megaview units are set to degC.
- Add own wheel mode for Suby VVT
- Add max MAP condition to nitrous (during launch)
- Sequential shift cut fuel also
- Pit lane limiter
- Flex ideas from Ben:
    Here are the tables that I think we need to blend based on FLEX% to make the flex function work correctly:
    cranking pulse
    afterstart enrichment
    warmup enrichment
    accel enrichment
    boost / overboost
    AFR table
    VE table
    Spark table
    * Some of these already exist, might be better to offer one blend for them all and a single master selector.
- Secondary AE for dual fuel also.
- Flex fuel sensing issues? Ref: AbeFM report on forum.
- Traction light output
- Consider more points in timed retard after launch (customer after 5 more)
- Progressive nitrous vs. MPH
- Extend size of progressive nitrous curve (10 points?)
- Variable tacho output
- Allow all available output pins to be controlled in i/o test mode.
- Traction Nitrous input pin polarity.
- Set all digin pins to respect Nitrous polarity.
- Respond to EGT per channel (James, P8)
- ALS throttle bumper always on.
- See if over-run transition is possible with staged injection (perhaps check for staging not being active)
- Respond to knock per-channel (awaiting feedback)
- Complete "loop" i/o feature.
- CAN passthrough corruption? (See pre-1.4 alpha1 topic.)
- Allow BattV and generic sensors to still work in test mode.
- Ford Coyote (in progress)

Rejected:
- Transient timing
- launch delay boost ought to be applied before duty is applied to output variable (Don't believe this is an issue.)
