MS3 CHANGELOG
=============
2009-05-08
Updated code to use new 0xF000 monitor with different jumperless reflash mechanism

2009-05-10 22:54 BST
Got 2 stage nitrous working on existing pins and MS3X pins. Tested all inputs and all outputs.
Changes in init.c to use pPTxpin[y] method for checking pin conflicts some more.

2009-05-20 BST
Various changes around monitor integration.

2009-05-28 BST
Changed TPSdot config data.
Experimenting with combined dialogues in ini for TS.

2009-05-31
Flex fuel, three port options. UNTESTED
Fix 1ms and slower clocks, was running at half speed.
Seconds was very close, runs from ECT TOF, adjusted.

Realtime baro port. Tested local ports read right port.
EGO2 port. Tested local ports read right port.
Inline ASM changes to use S12X
MAP reading can be configured to different port. Ports work ok.

Tacho out. Pins re-assigned and all tested ok.
Configure DDRJ for JS11 use.

Launch inputs. All tested ok.
Allow TC2 or TC5 as Cam input. This was fairly involved and required many
TCTL, TIE, TFLG1 settings to be changed. XGATE interrupt setting also changed.
Tested ok with V8 COP, V8 W/S in MS3X, plus LEDs for W/S.
Both cam inputs work and interrupts swap over.
Priming typo bug corrected (set spark on instead of fuel.)

Continuation on SDCard support. If card is inserted the card is queried and the
FAT in the lowest partition number is loaded to RAM.

2009-06-01 JSM
SDcard logging. Code writes a tiny datalog to the card.

2009-06-02
Sequential - not commented!

2009-06-03 JSM
Added TIMTimeroverflow test code
Fix XGATE spark code. TIE clearing disabled to make it work.
Other TC2/TC5 fixups.

2009-06-04 JSM
Added SDCARD write_block interrupt.
SDCARD now writes to card, but only alternate block in error.

2009-06-05 JSM
SDCARD now writes all sectors.

While dribble-burn is in process CLT, MAT, EGO lookups blocked to prevent reading bogus data.
Fixed missing hash typo bug in loop logger, likely causing crashes.

2009-06-06 JSM
SDCARD fully using interrupt driven code.
Old foreground code SD.c and SPI.c removed.

2009-06-07 JSM
SDcard now finds the address of LOG0000.MS3 in the root dir and writes a log to it.

Finds highest LOGxxxx.MS3 filename across multiple sectors of directory.
If it is empty then start logging.

More testing required, but almost there.
Finds the next log filenumber (or re-uses an empty one)
If new file is required it allocates a cluster chain and writes the directory entry.
Then logs to that file.

2009-06-08
sd_thisfile_sect wasn't being set on new files. So first write went to wrong place.

2009-06-09
At end of log a new file is started (for insertion mode.)

2009-06-10...12
Endless hours fighting SDHC init. Had omitted the 8 clocks after each command.
SDHC init working.
Added FAT32 support.
Almost there.

2009-06-13
Got there. SDHC and FAT32 supported. All cards I have tested and working. Possibly a few small
glitches yet to work out.

2009-06-15
KC - Added first working cut at sequential. Still a lot of work left
to do before it's "done".

2009-06-16 JSM
Adding datalog button and LED options.
Changes to conflict detection in init

2009-06-17 KC
Added first "align" attribute. Appears to work. Also fixed
priming pulse yesterday.

2009-06-18 KC
Fix problem that could occur when IC code tried to schedule injector
on event when the injectors are already on. Also, lock properly so that
on switchover to this state, there is no race condition causing lost
events.

2009-06-19 KC
Convert timers to 1usec again instead of 2/3 usec ticks, and attempt
to fix sequential injection not working on first sync.

2009-06-21 JSM

Config error blocked jsr code. Fixed.

2009-06-22 JSM
Priming on V3 injectors was inverted, leaving injectors on.
Fixed error in FIDLE conflict checking

2009-06-23 JSM
Button mode (but not WTF) seems to be working. Managed to corrupt a card while testing
insertion mode and card is not "broken" with Linux, Windows and MS3 not agreeing on a common
format. Need to write format routine in MS3 that is acceptable to all.

2009-06-24 JSM
SD. Added timeout to write FAT. Now detects broken 1G card.
Adding serial commands for SD. Not done write sector yet.

2009-06-25 JSM

Fix end and middle of pulse timing modes for seq.

2009-07-15 JSM
Stream level meter. Not sure the ASE holdoff is working.

Add code for injector trim. Still basic (timing does not change depending
on trim) and untested.

2009-07-18 JSM
Stream level meter again.

opening time twice).
Make EAE only do second channel stuff if it needs (EAE on 4 cyl now taking
~300 usec). Checked PID algorithms, none are taking a significant amount of
time.
Small change to seq trim to try to speed it up (save longxlong and replace with
longxint)
Protect map_temp by disabling interrupts when accessing it from the main loop.
