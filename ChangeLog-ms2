Historical MS2 Changelog removed from main. These changes were from the MS2/BG code
at the time of the first creation of MS2/Extra

Version 1.000
This version has all the basic capabilities of MS, but much higher precision -
in the usec range. It adds larger tuning tables (12x12), WBO2, IAC, dual tables,
and ignition control which assumes 1 coil and a mechanical distributor to
distribute spark or EDIS for multicoil wasted spark.
Version 1.100
Made serial comms more robust: added one word read, write + verify commands,
write to ram inhibit when overrun detection, receiver timeout check.
Version 1.200
Fixed various problems with trigger offsets ATDC (charge time can occur after
input capture at very low rpms and other related ignition timing problems.)
Version 1.300
Changed tps, tpsdot units to % x 10; added accel tailoff algorithm.
Version 2.000
This version works with the CAN v3 pcb and has a template for CAN comms.
Additional changes: increased input area to 4 x 512 byte blocks;
inhibit coil charge 2 sec after turning ign key on;
changed ports for FP, Idle (but connect to same pins on motherboard);
knock ADC input in Vx100; all unused ports initialized as inputs.
Made IACstart, PrimeP, CWU,CWH, AWEV,AWC,asecount ints instead of bytes.
PrimeP,AWEV,AWC made function of initial coolant temperature.
Expanded IAC control options for cranking plus switch to time based after
start; added pulse tolerance inputs for cranking and after start; IAC
option(5) to always enable stepper motor chip for 15 minutes after start,
then revert to option 2.
Version 2.100
Added crank trigger mode.Ignition fires with only mech adv during cranking;
added kpa to display outputs.
Version 2.200
Modified/ added ADC averaging: provided lag filter averaging for all
ADC inputs (also for rpm). Relocated VE tables in anticipation of
Block Learn Mode.
Version 2.300
Improved ego closed loop correction algorithms; flex fuel correction for
alternative fuels; generic spare output ports;fixed logic error for IdleCtl=5;
added fix to maintain coherence of inputs when changed thru serial port.
Version 2.310, 2.320, 2.330, 2340, 2.350
Fixed bug in ASE logic;set PW=0 in RevLimit mode;gcc compatibility changes;
fixed bug in spare port hysteresis; changed some defaults; fixed bug in masking
of TimerIn interrupts for dt/2; limited pw_open in case of battery spikes.
Version 2.400
Added automatic mixture control;mod to AE;expanded warmup inputs;
moved DoOnStack to permanent ram;added option for 2 NBs;added knock
retard based on ADC7 sensor.
Version 2.500
Added wheel decoding; added simple AE taper based on rpm;added time,% parameters
to control tach input interrupt masking; 5 sec min for persistence of AS pulse
tolerance; extended pulse tol range from 100 to 255.
Version 2.510, 2.520, 2.530, 2.540
Added fix to extend rpm range for wheel decoding; fixed AMC logic.
Version 2.600, 2.610, 2.620, 2.630, 2.640, 2.66
Added small model multi-page memory; added X-tau transient compensation; spark
retard as function of manifold air temperature; added table fuel corrections for
air density and barometric pressure; added spk retard correction for flex fuel;
added injector test mode. Fixed bug in table burner; added ego volt outputs;
shortened serial ISR time to expand wheel decoder range.

MS2/Extra code branch by Ken Culver and James Murray
Code split into files, more data pages, advanced wheel decoding, multiple spark outputs
Add in AG's 2.36 stepper idle fix

May/June 06 KC. Every tooth wheel decoder
31 Aug 06  JSM. Cranking PW% and alternate option
1 Sep 06  JSM. EGO2, FF, BARO2 can choose ADC ports (untested) Added start of 2nd trigger code

3 Sep 06  KC. More wheel decoder fixes, make main loop not block interrupts for 
nearly as long, add 32-bit calculation and timer capability for wheels with
small numbers of teeth
4 Sep 06  KC. Add Cranking advance, Cranking dwell, and fixed timing.
