TODO

1.2

Completed:
- Resolve duplication of "TPS accel" and "TPSaccel" outpc.tpsaccel and outpc.tps_accel (Ken) (Nothing to do for this. I created my own variables b/c I wanted
	      mine in %, but the standard algorithm expects and outputs in
	      milliseconds, so they're incompatible).
- Allow MAP logging to report a full cycle at low rpms
- Make MAF 'correction' table more sensible.
- Merge MAF calibration and correction
- Merge built-in baro curve with correction
- Review/rename menus and datalog fields for consistency and intuitive naming (mostly)
- Test mode to use new TS buttons feature
- Maximum VSS in launch
- Overdwell - regular spark
- Overdwell - rotary trailing
- Twin trigger - allow 2 stroke
- 'k' command for flash calibration tables too
- Twin trigger - allow "twin-trigger cam"
- TC perfect run rpm (coded but untested)
- TC include boost control (coded but untested)
- Status bytes to report input and output ports/pins.
- Make old AE in 0.01s units instead of 0.1s. Allow ignition events as an option.
- Monitor AFR for sane values and movement. Turn off EGOcor if out of range or stuck.
- Similar monitoring for other sensors.
- Check engine light
- Table blending / algo blending
- Phase sensing by MAP sensor (tested on engine)
- Cranking PW% curve blending (for flex)
- Consider MAFflow lookup - MS2/BG code uses an unsignedX flag on intrp1dc but that's not present in MS2 or MS3.
- Make loader look for ms3pro.s19 as well
- Double MAF range.
