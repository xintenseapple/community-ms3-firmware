"Always start in wasted COP
If poll level then prime tooth number from the cam level, but still run wasted
Check the cam for a _number_ of cycle to ensure it is where it should be and isn't where it shouldn't.
Keep running wasted until either
-cam phase is looking good -> switch to true COP
-cam is broken or a mess -> stay wasted COP and set CEL."
